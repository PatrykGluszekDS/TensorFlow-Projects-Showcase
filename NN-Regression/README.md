# 🚗 Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction (MPG) using Neural Networks and TensorFlow

This project aims to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon - MPG) based on various vehicle characteristics, using neural network regression built in TensorFlow.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Accurately predict fuel efficiency (MPG) from given vehicle features.
- Demonstrate regression modeling skills using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Clearly interpret and visualize the performance of the neural network.

## 📂 Dataset
